title: Setup

This workshop has been adapted from the original [Data Carpentry - Genomics workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop) to be conducted on the [NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz) compute infrastructure. All software and data is already set up for you to use during the workshop.

The original workshop is designed to be run on pre-imaged Amazon Web Services
(AWS) instances. For information about how to
use the original workshop materials, see the
[setup instructions](https://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/setup.html) on the main workshop page.
